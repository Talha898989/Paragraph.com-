	<u><h1>My Family</h1></u>
	<h2>My family is the most important thing in my life. I live with my parents and my younger sister. We love spending time together and doing fun things like watching movies, playing board games, or going for walks in the park.<br> <br>

		My mom is a teacher and she loves reading books. My dad works in an office and enjoys playing sports. My sister is still in school and loves playing with her toys and drawing pictures.<br> <br>
		
		We all have our own hobbies and interests, but we make sure to make time for each other. We support and care for each other no matter what, and I feel lucky to have such a loving family.<br> <br>
